# CASolarPowerUsage

This project analyzes the types of Solar Power installations and its accessibility throughout California, as renewable energy is becoming more and more prevalent. By visualizing this data, I aim to find trends and patterns in solar power installations that would help future infrastructure planning, solar energy and/or renewable energy policies, and strategies for increasing renewable energy usage as well.
